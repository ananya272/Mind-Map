#MIND MAP

A mind map is a visual tool used to organize information, ideas, or concepts around a central theme. It involves creating a diagram where the central idea is placed in the middle, with branches radiating outwards to represent related subtopics or concepts. Each branch can further branch out into more specific details, creating a hierarchical structure. Mind maps help in brainstorming, planning, studying, and understanding complex subjects by providing a clear, visual representation of relationships and connections between different pieces of information.
